## About Project:
The project is an application designed to convert long integers and fractional numbers from any numeral system to any other. It supports periodic numbers as well and includes efficient coded solutions for long arithmetic, rapid multiplication, FFT class, and a fraction handling class.

### The application includes:
+ Input field for the number to be converted;
+ Input field for specifying the source numeral system;
+ Input field for specifying the target numeral system;
+ Output field for displaying the converted result;
+ Buttons for controlling the application.

## Features:
+ Supports conversion between any numeral systems;
+ Handles periodic numbers;
+ Efficient long arithmetic operations;
+ User-friendly interface with clear input-output structure.

## Management:
+ `btnConvert` — initiates the conversion algorithm for the input number;
+ `btnSave` — saves the conversion result to a file;
+ `btnOpen` — opens a file to retrieve data for future conversions.
